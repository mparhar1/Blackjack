# Blackjack
The classic game of Blackjack (a.k.a. Twenty-One), implemented in Python 3 using object-orientated programming

# Game Objective
Beat the dealer by having a hand value closer to or exactly 21, without going over 21.

# Hand Value
A hand's value is the sum of the cards in the hand. An Ace has a value of 11 unless the total hand value exceeds 21, in which case it then takes the value of 1. Face cards have a value of 10 and all other cards take their pip value.

# Game Rules
  1) The player must hit (take an additional card to get closer to or exactly 21) or stand (not take anymore cards)
  2) One of the dealer's two starting cards will remain face down until it is time to reveal after the player ends their turn
  3) The dealer will hit until they reach 17
  4) Both the player and dealer can bust; however, if the player busts, they automatically lose, regardless of the dealer's hand
